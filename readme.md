# REST API with NodeJS/ExpresJS

This is an implemenation of restfull api with ExpressJS. It's a first time project to learn the basics of ExpressJS, but I will implement more complex stuff in the future. Right now only contains basic CRUD funcionality for simple posts. It also connects to MongoDB, all the necesary changes you need, to be able to play with it, attached in the code as comments.
You can start the server with npm command `npm run start`.
I used Prettier as a code formatter, therefore all the neccessary settings files are included in the repo. In case you want to use your own, just simply delete them.
